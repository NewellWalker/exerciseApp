// generate workout given selection boxes
// could potentially use AI in later versions, at first just use rng and class of movements (compound, accessory, steady state cardio, intervals, circuit)
// "Generate random workout!" button
// could have place that workout are shared and the most popular ones can be copied over (like social media / bodybuilding.com) but that is much further down the road
